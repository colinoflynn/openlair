If you have a PEMicro multilink with the ARM Cortex-M programming software, these scripts have details you can use for writing/reading from the attached SPI flash.

## Patching File ##

The complete script uses part of a file only distributed with the PROGACMP program. You will need the file `PEMicro\PROGACMP\supportFiles_ARM\FlashAlgorithms_External_SPI_ARMP\Generalplus_GPR25L12845E_8x16Meg_sw_spi.arp` which is then patched with the .patch file in this directory.
